# Introduction

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word transforms document creation and refinement, allowing you to produce compelling content with ease. Copilot assists with drafting from scratch, enhancing existing text, and distilling the essence of lengthy articles. With Copilot, you can start a document using brief prompts, seamlessly incorporate resources from across Microsoft 365, and adjust both tone and conciseness.


# Exercise

In the previous exercise, you researched company or product ideas and saved your notes to a document titled Copilot Research.docx.

In this exercise, you'll use Copilot in Word to articulate a comprehensive concept that includes the mission, vision, values, proposed offerings, target audience, and distinctive edge of your proposed company or product. Follow the prompts to have Copilot generate your concept and then refine it based on your input.

To reference the file, use the shared link to Copilot Research.docx.

>[!NOTE]
>In the instructions below, we will provide a sample prompt for each step. While you have the option to copy and paste these prompts, we encourage you to personalize them in your own style.
>If Copilot doesn't give you the desired output initially, refine your prompt.
>Remember to enjoy the proces!


## Task 1:

1. Open the Copilot Research.docx document that you saved to your OneDrive account in the previous exercise. Copy its URL by selecting Share in the upper-right corner and choosing Copy Link from the drop-down menu.

3. Open a new blank document.
4. Select Draft with Copilot which is located above the body of the document:

5. Enter the following prompt:

```md
Draft a concept for our new [company or product] referencing [link to Copilot Research.docx], including its mission, vision, core values, offerings, target audience, and unique market edge.```
```
>[!NOTE]
Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice.
>

6. Select Generate. At this point, Copilot in Word extracts the information from your research document and drafts the proposal.
7. Review the draft that Copilot creates. If everything looks good, you can move on to the next step.

However, if you'd like to refine the document further, explore the information in the Iterate and Revise section below.

8. Save the file to OneDrive as Product Concept.docx. Youâ€™ll use this document in the next exercise.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure to save the file to OneDrive instead of your local PC, as the next exercise in PowerPoint will require Copilot to access it.

##Task 2: Iterate and Revise

The iterative and revision process involves refining and improving upon an initial draft or concept through multiple rounds of feedback and adjustment. This approach helps to enhance the quality, clarity, and effectiveness of the final output by identifying areas for improvement and making targeted revisions.

For example, you might start with an initial draft of a concept and prompt the following:

```md
Can you refine this concept by making it more persuasive for potential sponsors?
```
After reviewing the updated version, you may further improve the document by focusing on specific sections, such as:
```md
Improve the summary to make it more concise and impactful.
```
Experimenting with these prompts allows you to refine your content through thoughtful adjustments, ultimately creating more persuasive and impactful content.
